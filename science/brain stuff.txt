Corpus Callosum
The network of neurons (nerves) that connects the Left & Right Hemispheres of the brain

The left and right hemispheres carry out many of the same functions and in the same ways.

` The organisation is contralateral - each hemispheres connects & coordinates to the opposite side of the body.
E.g. Movement - The right hand side of the brain coordinate muscles / movement for the left side of the body.
